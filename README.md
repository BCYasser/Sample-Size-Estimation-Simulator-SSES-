# Sample-Size-Estimation-Simulator-SSES-
This project is an attempt at providing a simulator for sample size estimation and statistical power computation. it uses a MonteCarlo approach generating N datas with n variables and build a model y=b1x+b2x..... in order to estimate power.  

This powerful approach is currently functional but needs optimization for spead as simulation for models with 3 variables might take up to 12 hours to computes
